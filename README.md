These are some of the projects I worked on to learn HTMX.  
These include:
* A request button to fetch data from an API
* A BMI Calculator web app
* A simulation of Bitcoin price changes
* A Search Widget that utilizes data fetched from an API
* An email address validator
* An updateable user profile

See it all happen on [my HTMX YouTube Playslist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqZ48CLs4vPy143P22LkRDWljYLn46Pqa)
